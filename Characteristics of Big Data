Volume:
Volume is a key contributor to the problem of why traditional relational database management systems 
(RDBMS, data warehouses as we know them today) fail to handle Big Data.  Underlying that failure are more complex issues 
of cost, reliability, long query times, and their inability to handle new sources of unstructured or semi-structured data like text.

Variety: 
Variety describes different formats of data that do not lend themselves to storage in structured relational database systems. 
These include a long list of data such as documents, emails, social media text messages, video, still images, audio, graphs, and the 
output from all types of machine-generated data from sensors, devices, RFID tags, machine logs, cell phone GPS signals,
DNA analysis devices, and more.  This type of data is characterized as unstructured or semi-structured and has existed all along.



Velocity:
This is one of the major determinants of Big Data storage, retrieval, analysis, and deployment architecture that companies
must work through today. When you sign on to Amazon or Netflix and see recommended purchases or views just for you the same process 
has taken place.  The architecture of capture, analysis, and deployment must support real-time turnaround (in this case fractions of a
second) and must do this consistently over thousands of new visitors each minute.  Real Time Big Data Analytics (RTBDA) is one of the main
frontiers of development in Big Data today.


Value:
It is equally true of both big and little data that if we are making the effort to store and analyze it then it must
be perceived to have value.

Veracity:It tells how trustworthy the data is that leads to the right direction while processing it.
