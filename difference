Scale out:(Horizontal scaling)
              1.Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources.

              2.It is often based on partitioning of the data i.e. each node contains only part of the data.

              3.With horizontal-scaling it is often easier to scale dynamically by adding more machines into the existing pool.

   Scale out:(vertical scaling)

              1.Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machineIn a database world.

              2.In vertical-scaling the data resides on a single node and scaling is done through multi-core.

              3.It is often limited to the capacity of a single machine, scaling beyond that capacity often involves downtime and comes with an 
               upper limit.
